## A conversation with Phind.
Note that header is me, and the standard paragraph is Phind.

## Oh is Watson an IBM product?

Yes, Watson is an IBM product. It is a question-answering computer system developed by IBM's DeepQA project, led by principal investigator David Ferrucci en.wikipedia.org. Watson was initially developed to answer questions on the quiz show Jeopardy! and won the first-place prize of 1 million USD in 2011 en.wikipedia.org. Since then, Watson has evolved into a collection of software tools that streamline and automate tasks in various areas like accounting, payments, technology operations, marketing, and customer service nytimes.com.

Watson's core capability is natural language processing (NLP), which powers IBM's popular Watson Assistant, used by businesses to automate customer service inquiries nytimes.com. IBM has made significant strides in recent years, with Watson performing as well as, and sometimes better than, AI services offered by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft advisory.com. The company has 40,000 Watson customers across 20 industries worldwide, more than double the number four years ago nytimes.com.

IBM has also extended Watson's capabilities to take advantage of new deployment models (Watson on IBM Cloud), evolved machine learning capabilities, and optimized hardware available to developers and researchers en.wikipedia.org. Watson can now 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'talk', 'taste', 'interpret', 'learn', and 'recommend', enabling it to be used in various applications, including education and healthcare en.wikipedia.org.


## The others I see, but can you elaborate on taste?

In the context of IBM's Watson, the "taste" aspect refers to Watson's ability to analyze recipes and create new dishes based on the flavor compounds of ingredients. Watson Chef, a computer program that helps cooks discover and create original recipes, uses flavor compound algorithms to generate recipes that combine ingredients with complementary flavors bonappetit.com.

To achieve this, Watson analyzes a database of recipes and identifies the most common ingredient pairings and combinations. It then focuses on the underlying logic and style of these recipes, essentially learning the fundamental chemical interactions between ingredients bonappetit.com. Watson can create recipes by considering multiple ingredient pairings at once, allowing it to generate unique dishes based on the chemical composition of the ingredients bonappetit.com.

For example, in the Bon Appétit food truck event, Watson created a Vietnamese apple kebab with pork, apples, mushrooms, and strawberries. The ingredients shared similar flavor compounds, including decanal, a ten-carbon aldehyde often responsible for citrus scents, which made the dish work bonappetit.com.

Watson's ability to "taste" and create recipes based on the flavor compounds of ingredients is an extension of its natural language processing capabilities. By understanding and reproducing the underlying logic and style of recipes, Watson can generate new dishes that combine ingredients in innovative ways while maintaining harmonious flavor profiles bonappetit.com.


## So tasting in this case isn't meant literally, but rather to pick recipes based on the ingrediants you chose.

Yes, that's correct. In the context of IBM's Watson, "tasting" doesn't mean literally tasting the food. Instead, it refers to Watson's ability to analyze recipes and create new dishes based on the flavor compounds of ingredients. Watson evaluates the taste-imparting molecules in each new combination of ingredients and approximates what the newly meshed flavors taste like by comparing their component chemical structures with similar mixtures already in the database spectrum.ieee.org. The system then determines whether a new taste is appealing by comparing the flavor combinations with existing research on how people like the flavors imparted by different combinations of compounds spectrum.ieee.org.


## I ask because apparently there is an artificial tungue being developed, though I have no idea how advanced it is.

Yes, there is an artificial tongue being developed, inspired by the human sensing mechanism. The artificial tongue can be prepared by UV polymerization on a flexible substrate and exhibit extraordinary sensing capabilities, such as a wide sensing range, a low limit of detectable concentration, and high selectivity from other tastes ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

The artificial tongue consists of a glass wafer featuring three separate arrays, each composed of 2 million tiny "artificial taste buds"—squares about 500 times smaller than a human taste bud, with sides just 100nm long theguardian.com. There are six different types of these squares in the device, three types made from gold and three from aluminum. While one type of gold and one type of aluminum are essentially bare, the surface of the other types are coated in different chemical substances.

When light is shone on an array, it interacts with the electrons at the surface of the squares, resulting in dips in the reflected light, which can be measured. These dips appear at slightly different wavelengths depending on which type of square the light interacts with theguardian.com.

The artificial tongue has been used to identify various single malt whiskies, as well as to detect poison and monitor rivers theguardian.com. Although it is not yet as advanced as IBM's Watson, the artificial tongue has potential applications in taste quantification, evaluation, studying taste disorders, and integration within humanoid robots phys.org.


## I'd be curious if that be a thing you can only give robots to make them more human like, or if humans that lost a tungue could use it to replace it? There is a subtle difference between simply detecting it, and tasting in the way humans do.

While the artificial tongue has potential applications in taste quantification, evaluation, studying taste disorders, and integration within humanoid robots pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, it is still challenging to fully mimic human tongue-like performance for tastes such as astringency science.org.

For humans who have lost their taste buds, there are alternative solutions such as the movable tongue prosthesis developed by researchers at Okayama University oralcancernews.org. This prosthesis aims to help oral cancer patients who have partially lost the ability to speak, and it does not focus on the sense of taste.

In summary, the artificial tongue is an exciting development with potential applications in various fields, but it is not yet advanced enough to fully replace human taste buds or provide a complete sense of taste for humans who have lost their taste buds. However, it does have potential applications in assisting robots and other technologies to perceive and analyze taste.


## For robots, it seems like one way to go about it is establishing a way for the robot to smell, as taste is closely related to smell. It can be thought of like smelling with your mouth.

You're right that taste and smell are closely related, and for robots, incorporating a sense of smell can be an effective way to simulate taste perception. There are already developments in robotics focused on the sense of smell, such as the "electronic nose" developed by Blanca Lorena Villarreal at Mexico's Tecnológico de Monterrey vice.com. This e-nose can be programmed to recognize several chemical signatures and can be integrated into various robotic devices for applications like search-and-rescue.

Another study conducted by researchers at the IIT-Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Italian Institute of Technology) in Rovereto (Italy) and Harvard University in Boston (USA) has identified the mechanisms used by our brain to recognize specific smells eurekalert.org. This research can potentially be applied to the development of an artificial sense of smell for robots in the future.

Incorporating a sense of smell in robots can enhance their ability to perceive and analyze various environmental factors, similar to how humans use their sense of smell. However, it's important to note that replicating the full complexity of human taste perception is still a challenge, and further research is needed to develop more advanced artificial senses for robots.


## Although given my imagination as a scifi writer, I could probably imagine a scenario where Watson could literally taste: but it would go a bit beyond pure chatbot technology: hardware with an electronic nose and tungue.

Your idea of incorporating an electronic nose and tongue into a Watson-like system is indeed an interesting concept, and it could potentially provide the robot with a more advanced sense of taste and smell. This would involve integrating hardware components that can mimic the mammalian olfactory and gustatory systems sciencedirect.com.

The electronic nose (e-nose) and electronic tongue (e-tongue) technologies have been developed to determine the quality-related properties of foods, and they have been applied in various fields, including clinical diagnostics and environmental pollution monitoring sciencedirect.com. These sensing devices use pattern recognition algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square regression (PLS), and support vector machine (SVM) sciencedirect.com.

Incorporating e-nose and e-tongue technologies into a Watson-like system would require the development of advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to process the information obtained from the sensors. This would enable the robot to perceive and analyze a wide variety of environmental factors, similar to how humans use their sense of smell and taste.

However, it's important to note that replicating the full complexity of human taste perception is still a challenge, and further research is needed to develop more advanced artificial senses for robots. Nonetheless, the integration of e-nose and e-tongue technologies into a Watson-like system could open up new possibilities for robotics and AI applications.


## Is it as complicated as trying to create machine conciousness?

Creating a machine with consciousness is indeed a complex and controversial topic. The development of a conscious machine would require overcoming several challenges, including understanding the nature of consciousness itself and the limitations of current AI and machine learning technologies scientificamerican.com.

Incorporating an electronic nose and tongue into a robotic system, as you mentioned earlier, is a different problem than creating machine consciousness. While it is a complex task, it does not involve the same level of understanding and replication of human cognitive processes that would be required for creating a conscious machine.

The concept of conscious machines raises several paradoxes and questions, such as the impact of subjective experiences on rational and optimal calculations, the limitations of machine cognition, and the implications of building a conscious machine that overcomes human capabilities ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

The ultimate goal of AI research should not be to create conscious machines that surpass human intelligence, but rather to develop better machines that can solve human problems more effectively and efficiently. This approach would involve moving away from anthropocentric presumptions and focusing on a general definition of intelligence ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

In summary, while creating a machine with consciousness is a complex and challenging task, it is a separate issue from incorporating sensing technologies like an electronic nose and tongue into a robotic system. The development of conscious machines raises significant ethical, philosophical, and practical questions that need to be addressed before such machines can become a reality.
